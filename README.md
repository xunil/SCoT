# SCoT - the Stars! Coalition Tool
This is an ancient Python/Tk app I wrote at the beginning of a turn-based strategy game session with a bunch of friends, circa 1997.

Stars! was a territory and resource control game, mostly based on VGA Planets.  Multiplayer involved each player loading the main game file, taking their turns, saving out a turns file, and handing it in to the person in charge of processing.  This person would run the turn processor, which would consume all the turn files and generate a new game file.  Tedious, but everything was in 1997.

This code has little to no educational value at this point, I keep it around mostly out of nostalgia.
